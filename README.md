Time series data, also referred to as time-stamped data, is a sequence of data points indexed in time order.
These data points typically consist of successive measurements made from the same source over a fixed time interval and are used to track change over time.
It helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time.

Examples of time series analysis:

1.Electrical activity in the brain
2.Rainfall measurements
3.Stock prices
4.Number of sunspots
5.Annual retail sales
6.Monthly subscribers
7.Heartbeats per minute
